The term 'remote branch' can refer to a branch in a remote git repository just
as easily as it can to a remote branch in a local git repository.  To avoid any
such ambiguity, the discussions here consistently refer to ordinary branches
(which only exist locally), local remote branches and remote remote branches.

Whilst 'local remote branch' may seem nonsensical and 'remote remote branch'
plain crazy, the distinctions are very important.

Occasionally the term 'remote branch' is used without one of the words 'local'
or 'remote' immediately preceding it.  In this case, care has been taken to
ensure that the term is qualified in some other lexically unambiguous manner.
