Create branch 'develop' locally:

 $ git checkout -b develop

-b is a shortcut telling git to create the branch before switching to it.  The
long way would be to do:

 $ git branch develop			# create branch
 $ git checkout develop			# switch to it

Create remote branches by pushing local branches to remote repositories, like
so:

 $ git push -u origin develop
 Enter passphrase for key '/home/sebyte/.ssh/id_rsa':

  * [new branch]      develop -> develop
 Branch develop set up to track remote branch develop from origin.

-u is short for --set-upstream and it tells git which branch to merge with in
future (when fetching/pulling, e.t.c.).  The long way would be to do:

 $ git push origin develop
 $ git branch --set-upstream develop origin/develop

In either case, what you are effectively doing is making a .git/config 'merge'
entry:

 [remote "origin"]
	 url = git@github.com:sebyte/gitana.git
	 fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
 [branch "develop"]
	 remote = origin
	 merge = refs/heads/develop

From now on, a simple:

 $ git push origin

or even

 $ git push

will suffice.
