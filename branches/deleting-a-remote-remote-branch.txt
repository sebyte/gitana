To delete a remote remote branch, either do:

 $ git push --delete origin testbranch

or

 $ git push origin :testbranch

See ./renaming-locally-and-remotely.txt for an explanation of colon notation.

N.B.  When you call:

 $ git branch -a

The list of branches are all local (even the remote ones).  The situation on the
remote server may be quite different.  If you get an error message that reads
something like this:

 error: unable to push to unqualified destination: <branch-name>
 The destination refspec neither matches an existing ref on the remote nor
 begins with refs/, and we are unable to guess a prefix based on the source ref.
 error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:<org>/<repo>.git'

this is probably because you are trying to delete a branch on the remote server
that no longer exists and all you really need to do is:

 $ git branch -dr <branch>

i.e. delete the remote branch locally.
