To delete a remote remote branch, either do:

 $ git push --delete origin testbranch

or

 $ git push origin :testbranch

One is syntactic sugar for the other.  The first form certainly makes clearer
what's actually going on.

This is definitely worth reading:

a number of times until you've grokked it.
