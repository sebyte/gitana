Having spent a few days working in branch 'development', I decided it was time
to have a go at preparing a new release, i.e., a merge of branch 'development'
with branch 'production', followed by the creation of a new tag on branch
'production'.

 $ git checkout production
 Switched to branch 'production'

 $ git merge development
 Updating c95c0c5..b350fdb
 Fast-forward

  ! [rejected]        development -> development (non-fast-forward)
 error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:sebyte/gitana.git'
 To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
 Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
 'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.

The error (above) occurred because I edited a file (in branch 'development')
using github's web interface and forgot to pull it before performing the merge.
Therefore when it came to the push, branch 'development' was out-of-date.

This also challenged my understanding of 'push'.  I had na√Øvely assumed that
push only dealt with a single branch at a time.  I can now see clearly that
that's not the case.


Haven't got around to the tagging part yet - FIXME
