I've been working in local branch 'development' (which tracks local remote
branch 'origin/development') and I'd like to create (and switch to) a local
branch 'production' (which tracks local remote branch 'origin/production').
Here's how to do it:

 $ git checkout --track origin/production

Here, the name of the new branch is based on the name of the local remote
('production').  To give your local branch a different name git checkout must be
called like this instead:

 $ git checkout --track -b prod origin/production
