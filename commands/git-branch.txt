* overview

`git branch' is a comparatively simple git command.  It is used to inspect,
rename, delete or create branches.  Inspecting, renaming and deleting branches
is in most cases trivial, but creating branches requires some thought.

Creating a branch is all about the 'start point'.  The command:

 $ git branch testbranch

is really shorthand for:

 $ git branch testbranch HEAD

where HEAD is the tip of the current (local) branch.  This becomes the start
point for testbranch.
