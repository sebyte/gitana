In this example, the production branch is behind the development branch:

 $ git checkout development
 $ git log --oneline --decorate=full production^..HEAD
 6775b7b (HEAD, refs/heads/development) Proper terminilogy ('SHA1 object names' rather than 'numbers').
 dff3ae3 (refs/remotes/github/sebyte/development) Comprehensive treatment on duplicating `svn status -u'.
 [...]
 1128d4a (refs/remotes/github/sebyte/production, refs/heads/production) Diffing deserves its own directory.

 $ git checkout production
 $ git log --oneline --decorate=full HEAD^..development
 6775b7b (refs/heads/development) Proper terminilogy ('SHA1 object names' rather than 'numbers').
 dff3ae3 (refs/remotes/github/sebyte/development) Comprehensive treatment on duplicating `svn status -u'.
 [...]
 1128d4a (HEAD, refs/remotes/github/sebyte/production, refs/heads/production) Diffing deserves its own directory.

I'm only interested in the refs (included thanks to --decorate=full) so I've
elided lines which don't mention any.

The output of both commands is intentionally more or less identical.  However,
it shows:

 • how to ensure that certain commits are included[1] (when labouring under an
   off-by-one thinko)

 • how HEAD moves when you switch branches

 • that development is ahead of its remote tracking branch by one commit


[1] The `^' specifies the ancestor of the named ref.
