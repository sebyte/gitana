In this example, I want to look at a specific log entry

 $ git-log --oneline -10
 592ff6d (HEAD, refs/remotes/origin/master, refs/remotes/origin/HEAD, refs/heads/master) doc/bbdb.texi: Add @dircategory and @direntry
 65dfccf m4/package_date.m4: Use more robust output redirection
 c57e073 m4/emacs_vm.m4: Fix typo
 6058831 m4/emacs_vm.m4: Define mconditional VM unconditionally
 03fb7a8 Further clean up of autoconf
 2f1ef48 Clean up usage of automake and autoconf
 eaba4d7 INSTALL: fix typos
 f6a9dd3 INSTALL: fix typo
 8052478 Use Automake
 d5105a0 bbdb-mua-auto-update: Use bbdb-pop-up-layout

Perhaps surprisingly `git-log 8052478' doesn't work, so use:

 $ git show 8052478 --[short]stat

instead.


In this example, the production branch is behind the development branch:

 $ git checkout development
 $ git log --oneline --decorate=full production^..HEAD
 6775b7b (HEAD, refs/heads/development) Proper terminilogy ('SHA1 object names' rather than 'numbers').
 dff3ae3 (refs/remotes/github/sebyte/development) Comprehensive treatment on duplicating `svn status -u'.
 [...]
 1128d4a (refs/remotes/github/sebyte/production, refs/heads/production) Diffing deserves its own directory.

 $ git checkout production
 $ git log --oneline --decorate=full HEAD^..development
 6775b7b (refs/heads/development) Proper terminilogy ('SHA1 object names' rather than 'numbers').
 dff3ae3 (refs/remotes/github/sebyte/development) Comprehensive treatment on duplicating `svn status -u'.
 [...]
 1128d4a (HEAD, refs/remotes/github/sebyte/production, refs/heads/production) Diffing deserves its own directory.

I'm only interested in the refs (included thanks to --decorate=full) so I've
elided lines which don't mention any.

The output of both commands is intentionally more or less identical.  However,
it shows:

 • how to ensure that certain commits are included[1] (when labouring under an
   off-by-one thinko)

 • how HEAD moves when you switch branches

 • that development is ahead of its remote tracking branch by one commit

[1] The `^' specifies the ancestor of the named ref.
