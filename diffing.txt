git diff is a complex command.

Don't start at the top of the page, rather (gitman "diff" 744).

Comparing branches
------------------

 $ git diff                production..development
 $ git diff --name-status  production..development
 $ git diff --stat --color production..development

The first of these is very verbose.  The last two are concise.

 $ git log                 production..development
 $ git shortlog            production..development

Similarly, shortlog is more concise.
