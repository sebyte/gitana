Created an empty git repository on my local machine:

 $ cd ~/git
 $ mkdir gitana
 $ git init

and added a README:

 $ git add README
 $ git commit -m 'Initial commit'

It's necessary to commit a file at this early stage because branch 'master'
doesn't actually exist until you perform your first commit (despite the fact
that ruynning 'git status' at this stage suggests it does) and you can't create
further branches (or rename branch 'master') unless branch 'master' exists.
