Create an empty git repository on local machine:

 $ cd ~/git
 $ mkdir gitana
 $ git init

Add a README file and commit:

 $ git add README
 $ git commit -m 'Initial commit'

It's necessary to commit a file at this early stage because branch 'master'
doesn't actually exist until you perform your first commit (despite the fact
that running 'git status' at this stage suggests it does) and you can't create
further branches (or rename branch 'master') unless branch 'master' really does
exists.
