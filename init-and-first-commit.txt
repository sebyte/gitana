Create an empty git repository on your local machine:

 $ cd ~/git
 $ mkdir gitana
 $ cd gitana
 $ git init

At this point you may decide to create a new branch, or change the name of
default branch from 'master' to something else?

Well, you can't.

"Why on earth not?" I can hear you thinking.

That's OK.  I thought exactly the same thing.

The fact is, you can't create more branches (or rename branch 'master') until
branch 'master' actually exists, and it doesn't exist until you perform your
first commit.  So...

Create a README file, add it and commit:

 $ git add README
 $ git commit -m 'Initial commit'

Now you can start playing with branches.
