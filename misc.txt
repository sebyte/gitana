Every subdirectory in a Subversion working copy has its own .svn/ subdirectory
whereas git working copies have just one .git/ subdirectory (at the top level)
and no more.


Files are either untracked, staged or tracked.  git knows nothing about
untracked files (except that they exist).  Staged files are by definition new
files, i.e., files that are about to be committed for the first time.  And
tracked files are files which have already been committed and are therefore
either unmodified or modified, in which case they contain staged or unstaged
changes (or both).


Emacs users should make add the following to their ~/.gitconfig:

 [core]
   excludesfile = ~/.gitexcludes

and their ~/.gitexcludes should read:

 \#*
 .#*

(without the single space indentation).
