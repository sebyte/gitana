List remote repositories:

 $ git remote [-v]

Adding a remote repository called 'origin' couldn't be simpler:

 $ git remote add origin git@github.com:sebyte/gitana.git

Renaming a remote repository couldn't be much simpler either:

 $ git remote rename origin sebyte

Names of remotes may even include forward slashes:

 $ git remote rename sebyte github/sebyte

One way to check the result is to issue the command:

 $ git config --list | grep '^remote'

Another way is simply to visit the file .git/config and see for yourself.
