Adding a remote repository called 'origin' couldn't be simpler:

 $ git remote add origin git@github.com:sebyte/gitana.git

Renaming a remote repository couldn't be much simpler either:

 $ git remote rename origin github.com

One way to check the result is to issue the command:

 $ git config --list

Another way is simply to visit the file .git/config and see for yourself.

On second thoughts, 'github.com' is not a very sensible name for a remote
repository.  'origin' is much better.  As a rule of thumb, if the remote
repository is one of yours, i.e., one over which you have complete control, then
the name you give the remote repository should probably describe its function,
not its location or anything like that.  If the remote repository belongs to a
collaborator, then the name you give it should probably identify the
collaborator.

It's really not all that important, especially not at this stage, and bear in
mind that 'remotes' are all defined on a local (working copy) basis.
