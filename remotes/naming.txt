'origin' is not very descriptive so let's rename it in such a way as to identify
the particluar github repository:

 $ git remote rename origin github.com/sebyte/gitana

.git/config now reads:

 [remote "github.com/sebyte/gitana"]
	 url = git@github.com:sebyte/gitana.git
	 fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github.com/sebyte/gitana/*
 [branch "develop"]
	 remote = github.com/sebyte/gitana
	 merge = refs/heads/develop

However, this is not a good idea since the full name of a remote branch (as
listed by 'git branch -r') is a combination of the name you give it and the path
component (sans file suffix) of the remote URL, hence 'sebyte/gitana' is now
included twice:

 $ git branch -r			# -r for remotes only
 remotes/github.com/sebyte/gitana/sebyte/gitana/develop

This is confisuing at best (and might cause real problems) so let's just use
'github.com' as the name of our remote repo:

 $ git remote rename github.com/sebyte/gitana github.com
 $ git branch -r
 remotes/github.com/sebyte/gitana/develop
