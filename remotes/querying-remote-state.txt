 $ git ls-remote [options] [repo] [refs]

is one of the few ways there are of querying the current state of play on a
remote server.

Without args it lists all references in the upstream remote of your current
local branch.

 $ git ls-remote .

lists all local references.  [1]






[1] I wonder how many people have this line in the [alias] section of their
    ~/.gitconfig:

     ls-local = ls-remote .
