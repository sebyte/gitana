 $ git ls-remote [options] [repo] [refs]

is one of the few ways there are of querying the current state of play of a
remote repository.

Without args, it will list the refs from the remote repo your current branch
tracks.

 $ git ls-remote

Given a repo argument, it will list the refs from that remote repo instead:

 $ git ls-remote edicl/hunchentoot

Given a repo argument of `.', it will list all local refs. [1]

 $ git ls-remote .



[1] I wonder how many people have this line in the [alias] section of their
    ~/.gitconfig:

     ls-local = ls-remote .
