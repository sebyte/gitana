An interesting discussion on the git equivalent of the Subversion command:

 `svn status -u'

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1138990/git-equivalent-of-svn-status-u

In short, you must update your local remotes (with `git remote update' or `git
fetch') and then issue a `git log' command.  However this is not a complete
equivalent since `svn status -u' displays information on local and remote
changes *combined*.

   Subversion					git
   ----------					---
 1 centralised					distributed

 2 `svn commit'					`git add' & `git push' combined

 3 `svn checkout'				`git clone'


 Notes
 -----

 1 This is the critical difference.  Each repository has the capacity to act as
   the central repository (hence `git clone').  In other words, a git repository
   is "central" by social convention only, not by technical limitation.

 2 When issued the command `svn commit', Subversion checks the central
   repository first to see whether any of the files to be committed are
   out-of-date.  Even if the changes would not conflict, the entire commit will
   fail if a single out-of-date file is included in the commit.
